Several machine models were trained on the Titanic Kaggle data (train.csv) and evauluated with various metrics. K Nearest Neighbors was found to yield the highest mean cross val score and AUC, so the submission was generated using KNN on the test data. One-Hot Encoding was used to enconde the embarkation port, while cabin, passengerid, and name was dropped.

The Jupyper notebook walks one through the preprocessing and training.

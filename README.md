#TitanicKaggleSubmissions

Several machine models were trained on the Titanic Kaggle data (train.csv) and evauluated with various metrics. K Nearest Neighbors was found to yield the highest mean cross val score and AUC, so the subbion was generated using KNN on the test data.

The Jupyper notebook walks one through the preprocessing and training.
